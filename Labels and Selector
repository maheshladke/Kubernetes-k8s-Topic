Imagine your Kubernetes cluster as a massive library.

*Labels* are like tags on books (e.g., "mystery", "bestseller"). They help categorize and identify resources.
*Selectors* are like a librarian searching for books with specific tags. They find resources that match the criteria.

*Why it's useful:*
- Organize resources efficiently.
- Easily find and manage specific resources.
- Automate tasks based on labels.

`kubectl label pod <pod-name> <key>=<value>`
`kubectl get <object> --show-labels`
`kubectl get pods -l app=my-app`
`kubectl label --overwrite pod <pod-name> <key>=<new-value>`
