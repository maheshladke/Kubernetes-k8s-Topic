If you're working with Kubernetes, understanding Namespaces is key to organizing and managing your resources efficiently. Whether you're isolating environments for dev, testing, or production, Namespaces allow you to divide and conquer!

Why Namespaces Matter:

Simplifies resource management, especially in large teams or multi-project environments.
Allows you to segment clusters for different teams (e.g., team1.myservice, team2.myservice).
Makes it easy to view, assign, and manage resources across specific namespaces.

#kubectl get namespace
#kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
#kubectl get pods --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
# Create a new namespace named my-namespace
  kubectl create namespace my-namespace
