 Kubernetes vs Docker: What's the Difference? 

Docker is a platform for containerization. It allows you to package applications with their dependencies into containers, making deployment and management simpler.

 Key Features of Docker:
1.Container creation and management
2.Dockerfiles for container configuration
3.Docker Hub for sharing container images
4.Networking for container communication
5.Persistent data storage through volumes

Kubernetes (K8s), on the other hand, is a container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across multiple hosts.

Key Features of Kubernetes:
1.Automated container deployment
2.Self-healing (restarts failed containers)
3.Horizontal scaling of applications
4.Load balancing
5.Rolling updates and rollbacks
6.Secret and configuration management

 The Relationship Between Docker and Kubernetes:
Docker creates containers, while Kubernetes manages and orchestrates them at scale.

1.Docker creates the "ships" (containers).
2.Kubernetes is the "harbor master" that directs where the containers should go, ensures they’re running, and scales them when needed.

⚖️ When to Use Which:
1.Docker alone: Best for smaller projects or development environments.
2.Kubernetes: Ideal for large-scale, dynamic applications that need scaling or high availability.



1.Docker is about containerization.
2.Kubernetes is about orchestration.
3.Both work together to run and manage modern cloud-native applications.
